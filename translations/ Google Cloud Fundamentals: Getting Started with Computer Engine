# LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Computer Engine

### Objectives:


In this lab you will learn how to perform the fellowing tasks:

  -  Create a computer engin virtual machine using the google cloud plaform (GCP) console.

  -  Create a computer engine virtual machine using the glcoud command-line interface.

  -  Coneect between the two instance.

# Steps:

1.  Create a computer engine virtual machine using the google cloud plaform (GCP) console.

    glcloud computer instance create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" -- image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" -- subnet "default" -- tags http

    gcloud computer firewall-rules create allow-http -- action=allow --destination=INGRESS -- rules= http:80 -- target-tags=http

2. Create a compute engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.
    gcloud config set computer create my-vm-2 -- machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-prpject "debian-cloud" -- image "debian-9-stretch-v2019213" --subnet  "default"

3. Connect between the two instances

  1. Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:
     -  Connect to my-vm-2:
            
               gcloud computer ssh my-vm-2

     - ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:

               ping -c 4 my-vm-1

     - Use the  ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1 from my-vm-2

               ssh my-vm-1

      -  The command promt on my-vm-1 install the Nginx web server:

               sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

      - use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server

               sudo nano  /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

      - move your curser with the arrow key to below h1 header then add text , replace YOUR_NAME with your name.

               Hi from  FRANCIS

      - Exit the editor, run the command on the command prompt on my-vm-1

               curl http://localhost

       - RESULT:

               The response will be the HTML source code of the web server's home page, including custom text.

       - Type Exit in the command prompt of my-vm-1

       - confirm my-vm-2 reach my-vm-1 on the web server, in the command prompt of my-vm-2 type

               curl http://my-vm-1/

2. To get external IP of my-vm-1 instance, execute this command
  
            glcloud computer instance list

      - Past the IP address of my-vm-1 on a new web browser, hit enter

      - Result: The custom test will display ON THE  WEB BROWSER
